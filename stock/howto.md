## Creating a basic txtpage 

Enter a **Title** for your txtpage.  
Enter some text in the **Content** box.  
Click **Create Page**.

That's it!

*Note: TxtPage contents are formatted using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview) .*


## Specifying a url for your txtpage

Enter some text in the **Custom URL** box (for example: *cathome*).  
Your txtpage can then be accessed via the link *txtpages.xyz/cathome* .  
You will be prompted to enter a different custom url if it used previously.  


## Specifying a passcode for your txtpage

A passcode is needed to edit an existing txtpage. 

Enter the passcode you want to set in the **Passcode** box (for example: *password123*) . If you leave the passcode box blank, then a random passcode will be generated for you.

Write down the passcode somewhere or email it to yourself.


## Editing an existing txtpage

To edit an existing txtpage, you need to know its url and passcode. For instance, to edit a txtpage with the url *cathome*, access the following link: *txtpages.xyz/cathome/edit* .

You will be able to edit any of the txtpage content. Enter the correct passcode to save changes.


## Creating a heading

To create a heading, use the following formatting:

```
# Primary Heading
## Secondary Heading
### Smaller Heading
#### Even smaller heading
```


## Formatting paragraphs

Leave an empty line in between paragraphs.

To start a new line (without starting a new paragraph), add two spaces at the end of the line.


## Formatting text

Enclose text in asterisks for italic or bold text.

```
*italic text*.  
**bold text**.
```

Enclose text in backticks (`) for `code` text.

```
Here's some `code text` for you.
```

Use three dashes (---) on a line by itself for a horizontal rule.

```
A line of text followed by a horizontal rule.
---
```

Add a '>' in front of a paragraph to turn it into a blockquote.

```
> This is a paragraph rendered into a blockquote.
```

## Adding web links

Use the following formatting to add a web link:

```
[This is a link](https://txtpages.xyz)  
```

## Linking to an image

Use the following to link to an image:

```
![image alt text](http://txtpages.xyz/logo.png)  
```


## Creating a list:

```
Bulleted lists:  
- eggs  
- milk  
- flour  

Numbered lists:  
1. eggs  
2. milk  
3. flour  
```


## Deleting old txtpages

TxtPages that haven't been viewed in 6 months will be deleted.
