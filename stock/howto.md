# TxtPages How-to

Give your txtpage a **title**. This will appear as the page title and top heading. 

Optionally specify a **custom url** that will be part of the web page link. If you don't specify a custom url, one will be generated for you.

Optionally specify an **edit code**. You need to enter this code when you make changes to the page. This code can't be retrieved, so you need to write it down somewhere.

Enter web page **content** in plain text using markdown syntax. Below is a quick cheat sheet on how to use Markdown:

## Markdown Syntax

Headings:    
\# Primary heading  
\#\# Secondary heading  
\#\#\# Subheading, and so on.  

Use an empty line to separate paragraphs from each other. This is the first paragraph.

And this is the next paragraph. With a blank line separating it from the previous paragraph.

\**italic text*\*  
\*\***bold text**\*\*  

Define links to other pages:  
\[This is a link\]\(http://txti.es\)  

Embed an image:  
\!\[image alt text\]\(http://https://i.imgur.com/WUtsRM9.png\)  

Bulleted lists:  
\- eggs  
\- milk  
\- flour  

Numbered lists:  
1\. eggs  
2\. milk  
3\. flour
