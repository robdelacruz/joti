# About TxtPages

Create plain text webpages, blog posts, reference pages, or quick notes. The page you create will have a unique url which you can share with others.

TxtPages is a clone of the popular [Txti](https://txti.es/) tool for creating fast text web pages.

TxtPages will always be free and open source. Source files are available on [github](https://github.com/robdelacruz/txtpages). Feel free to copy the code and deploy to your own hosting service.
