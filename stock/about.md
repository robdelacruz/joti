# About TxtPages

Quickly create blog posts, reference pages, write down your thoughts. The page you create will have a unique url which you can share with others.

TxtPages is a clone of the popular [Txti](https://txti.es/) tool for creating fast text web pages.

TxtPages will always be free and open source. Feel free to copy the [code](https://github.com/robdelacruz/txtpages), and deploy to your own hosting service.
