# About Joti

Joti is a clone of the popular [Txti](https://txti.es/) tool for creating fast text web pages. Use Joti to quickly create blog posts, reference pages, write down your thoughts, send links to the pages you create.

Joti will always be free and open source. Feel free to copy the [code](https://github.com/robdelacruz/joti), and deploy to your own hosting service.
